# CarciniScript plan

CarciniScript compiles a practical subset of Rust to ES modules, with v3 source maps, synchronously,
in the browser, at runtime. The first consumer is Bitburner (`.rs` scripts), following the same
integration shape as RapydScript-NS (`.py` scripts) in `bytburner-src`.

> *Carcinisation*: the tendency of evolution to keep producing crabs. Every language eventually
> becomes Rust.

## Contracts inherited from the RapydScript integration

| Concern | Python (RapydScript-NS) today | CarciniScript |
|---|---|---|
| Compile call | `web_repl().compile_mapped()`, sync, pure JS | Sync after one async `init()` (same as `@swc/wasm-web`) |
| Output | ES module, `export async function main(ns)`; evaluator rewrites `import` specifiers to blob URLs | Same |
| Runtime library | Baselib injected once onto `window` (`ρσ_*`) | Prebuilt runtime installed once on `globalThis.κσ` |
| Source maps | v3 JSON from compiler mappings, inlined by `NetscriptJSEvaluator` | Same; no evaluator change |
| Cross-file imports | `buildPythonVirtualFiles()` → `{ "dir/mod": code }` | Same with `.rs`; the type checker needs other files' signatures |
| RAM cost | `parseAST()` compiles then acorn-parses the JS | Same, so output must keep literal `ns.hack(...)` member calls |
| Editor | `registerRapydScript(monaco)` + `addDts(netscriptDefinitions)` | `registerCarciniScript(monaco)` + generated `ns.rs` bindings |

## Why not real rustc → wasm

- rustc + sysroot is hundreds of MB; compiles take seconds.
- Every NS call returns a Promise. Wasm can only block on one via JSPI, which is not universal.
- Bitburner's RAM calculator needs a JS AST.
- Wasm debugging needs DWARF tooling; JS + source maps just works in devtools.

## Architecture

```
carciniscript/
  compiler/          Rust crate → wasm-bindgen
    parse            ra_ap_syntax (rust-analyzer's error-resilient parser)
    lower            CST → simplified HIR                     (phase 1)
    typeck           whole-function inference + checking      (done for the current subset)
    codegen          HIR/AST → JS text + mapping records
    sourcemap        `sourcemap` crate → v3 JSON
  prelude/std.rs     std surface as Rust signatures + #[js = "..."] mappings   (phase 1)
  runtime/rt.js      Option/Result, iterators, HashMap, fmt, panics
  language-service/  registerCarciniScript(monaco, opts)                       (phase 2–3)
  tools/dts2rs.ts    NetscriptDefinitions.d.ts → ns.rs bindings               (phase 2)
  test/              fixtures + differential tests (native rustc vs node)
  docs/RUST_GAPS.md  counterpart to RapydScript's PYTHON_GAPS.md
```

**Parser: `ra_ap_syntax`, not `syn`.** syn stops at the first error, which makes for poor editor
diagnostics. ra_ap_syntax recovers, keeps byte ranges, and covers the full grammar. Its API churns,
so the version is pinned.

**Types are the hard part.** Unlike Python, Rust semantics depend on static types:
`7 / 2` is integer division for `i32`, float division for `f64`, and JS can't tell `4` from `4.0`
at runtime. Method resolution, `.into()`, `Default::default()` and `{}` vs `{:?}` all go through
types. Function signatures are always annotated, so local bidirectional inference is tractable.
We check against `prelude/std.rs` and generated `ns.rs`; we do not use `ra_ap_hir` (needs the whole
std source, unstable API).

## Lowering decisions

See [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) for the per-feature chart. The load-bearing decisions:

- **Borrows and lifetimes** are erased in codegen. Exceptions: `&mut` taken on a primitive local
  boxes that local into a cell; `Copy` structs are cloned on assignment and by-value passing.
- **Integers:** `i8..i32`/`u8..u32` wrap (`|0`, `>>>0`, masks). `i64`/`u64`/`usize`/`isize` are JS
  numbers (exact to 2^53; gap). `i128`/`u128` are BigInt. Integer `/` truncates and panics on zero;
  JS `%` already matches Rust's truncated remainder.
- **Option:** `None` is `null`, `Some(x)` is `x`. `Option<Option<T>>` and `Option<()>` are rejected.
  The NS boundary is free: `undefined` results read as `None`.
- **Result:** tagged object; `?` is an early return.
- **Panics** throw `CarciniPanic` with `file:line:col` baked in at compile time.
- **Structs/enums:** structs → classes with all `impl` blocks merged; field-less enums → numbers;
  data enums → tagged objects; `match` → decision chain.
- **Collections:** `Vec` = JS `Array`; `HashMap`/`HashSet` = runtime class with structural key
  hashing for tuple/struct keys; iterators = lazy runtime adapter class.
- **Strings:** JS strings; `len()` and byte-range slicing go through UTF-8 helpers.
- **Async:** `pub async fn main(ns: NS)` → `export async function main(ns)`; `.await` → `await`.
- **`println!`** → `console.log`. Modules are cached across scripts, so there is no single `ns` to
  print to; scripts should use `ns.tprint(&format!(..))`.
- **Modules:** each `.rs` file is a module; `use crate::a::b::item` → `import { item } from "a/b"`.
- **Runtime names** live under `κσ` so none collide with NS function names in RAM calculation.

## Borrow checking (static, in the compiler)

Borrowing and lifetimes are compile-time concepts; the emitted JS is identical either way.
Erasing them only means programs rustc would reject still run. Tiers:

1. **Move checking** (phase 1): use-after-move via init/move dataflow. Needs only `Copy`-ness.
2. **NLL-lite** (after the language service): per-function CFG, borrow liveness, conflict
   reporting; elided/annotated signatures across calls. Shown as warnings; a "strict" setting
   makes them errors.
3. **Polonius** (not planned): would need MIR-like lowering and region inference.

Optional debug mode: RefCell-style runtime guards on collections (e.g. mutate-while-iterating
panics instead of silently misbehaving).

## NS bindings

`tools/dts2rs.ts` uses the TypeScript compiler API on `NetscriptDefinitions.d.ts`:
`number` → `f64`, `string` → `String`, `T[]` → `Vec<T>`, optional / `T | undefined` → `Option<T>`,
`Promise<T>` → `impl Future<Output = T>`, interfaces → extern structs.

## Source maps

The codegen writer tracks output line/column and records a mapping at each statement and
expression back to the Rust byte offset, converted to line + UTF-16 column. The `sourcemap` crate
encodes v3 JSON. Bitburner's existing inlining in `NetscriptJSEvaluator.ts` is unchanged.

## Bitburner integration (in `bytburner-src`)

- `src/Paths/ScriptFilePath.ts`: add `".rs"`.
- `src/utils/ScriptTransformer.ts`: `FileType.RS`, `getFileType("rs")`, `isRust`, RS branch in
  `parseAST`; generalize `buildPythonVirtualFiles` over extension.
- `src/utils/rust/compileCarciniScript.ts` (modeled on `compileRapydscript.ts`): `init()` at
  startup next to swc, install runtime once, `compile` / `compileWithSourceMap`.
- `src/NetscriptJSEvaluator.ts`: `case FileType.RS`.
- `src/ScriptEditor/ScriptEditor.ts`: register the language service; feed `ns.rs`.
- `ScriptEditorRoot.tsx`: virtual files; skip JS infinite-loop detection for `.rs` (language
  service warns on `loop`/`while` with no `.await` instead).
- `ui/utils.ts`: language `"rust"` (Monaco has Rust highlighting built in).
- `Terminal/commands/common/editor.ts`: `.rs` template.

## Phases

0. **Spike** (compiler done; Bitburner wiring next):
   - [x] ra_ap_syntax → wasm (~700 KB). Needs `--cfg no_salsa_async_drops`, see
     `compiler/.cargo/config.toml`.
   - [x] Codegen for `fn`, `let`, `if`/`loop`/`while`/`for`-over-range, labeled loops, typed
     arithmetic and casts, `.await`, NS method calls, `println!`/`format!` (incl. width,
     precision, `{:?}`), `panic!`/`assert*!`.
   - [x] Source maps (statement and expression granularity).
   - [x] Node harness: differential tests vs native rustc, NS mock scripts, source map and
     diagnostics checks.
   - [x] Web REPL with in-browser self-test; crash sweep over 8.7k real-world `.rs` files
     (cargo registry + std) with 0 panics.
   - [ ] Wire `.rs` into Bitburner. Done when `ns.hack(&t).await` runs, devtools breakpoints land on
     Rust lines, and RAM cost is right.
1. **Core language:**
   - [x] Type checker (`typeck.rs`): inference across a function body, rustc-style type and
     mutability errors. Codegen reads its type table.
   - [x] `Vec<T>`: `vec!`, array literals, bounds-checked indexing, mutation methods, `for` loops
     (including `&mut`), `{:?}`, `==`, `clone`.
   - [x] `Option`, `if let` / `while let` / `let ... else`, `match` (literals, ranges, `|`,
     guards, `@`), exhaustiveness for `bool` / `Option` / catch-alls.
   - [x] `?` on `Option` (`Result` comes with enums)
   - [x] Typed NS bindings: `tools/dts2rs.mjs` generates `bindings/ns.rs` from
     NetscriptDefinitions.d.ts; Bitburner regenerates its copy with `npm run generate:rust-bindings`
     and a jest test fails when it's stale.
   - [x] Tuples and destructuring (patterns, `enumerate`, swap assignment, value copies)
   - [x] Closures and iterator adapters (plus `Ordering`, sorting with closures, and the `Option` / `HashSet` / `HashMap` methods they unblock)
   - [x] `HashSet` (the starter-script milestone: `test/ns/crawl.rs`)
   - [x] `HashMap` (including the `entry` API and write-through iteration)
   - [ ] `struct` + `impl` + derives, then `enum` with data
   - [ ] Warn on `loop`/`while` with no `.await`
   - [ ] Move checking
2. **Multi-file:** `use` across files, virtual files, `dts2rs`, Monaco diagnostics.
3. **Language service:** completion, hover, signature help from the checker's symbol tables.
4. **Later:** generic trait dispatch (`T::assoc()`), `macro_rules!`, wider std, optional
   overflow-checking mode, NLL-lite borrow warnings, performance.

## Testing

- **Differential:** a corpus of subset programs runs under native `cargo run` and as transpiled JS
  under node; stdout must match.
- **Source maps:** assert specific Rust lines map to the expected JS.
- **Bitburner:** RAM cost and import integration tests.

## Risks

- **Type inference scope creep:** iterator chains with closures need generic inference over std
  signatures. Keep the std surface small and grow on demand.
- **Silent divergence:** `Copy` structs, `&mut` primitives, UTF-8 vs UTF-16, `i64` precision.
  Every one goes in `RUST_GAPS.md`.
- **No full borrow checker:** programs rustc rejects can still run. Documented.
- **ra_ap_syntax churn:** pinned version; upgrades are deliberate.
